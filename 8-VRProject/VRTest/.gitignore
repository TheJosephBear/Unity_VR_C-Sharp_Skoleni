# Optional: Ignore files from Asset Store packages you don't want to track
# e.g., if you have specific tools you don't want shared or if they contain large binaries
# You would need to add specific paths here, for example:
# /Assets/Plugins/MyLargePlugin/

# Uncomment this section if you want to ignore all binaries in the build folders
# **/*.exe
# **/*.dll
# **/*.apk
# **/*.unitypackage
